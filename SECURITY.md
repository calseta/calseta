# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Calseta, please report it by emailing **security@calseta.com**.

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.** Public disclosure before a fix is available puts users at risk.

Include in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any proof-of-concept code if applicable

You can expect an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We'll keep you informed as we work toward a fix and will credit you in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This policy covers the core Calseta platform — the FastAPI server, MCP server, worker process, and official integrations in this repository.

It does not cover third-party enrichment providers (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Okta, Microsoft Entra) or any infrastructure you run Calseta on.

## Supported Versions

Calseta is pre-MVP. Once v1.0 is released, this section will document which versions receive security fixes.
